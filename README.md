#Buster!

## Bust a brick or 50

I always liked Buster, the human-analog "crash test dummy" used on
Mythbusters for various myth tests. But we are not here to bust myths
today, just bricks.

Remember the Golden Age of the Arcade, around the 1980s or so? It was
a pacman-eat-dot industry, where a game that didn't earn a quarter
every three minutes got removed and replaced. So, the games were built
to have lights and sounds to attract the player, and then to challenge
the player enough that he's likely to lose the game...fast. Still,
from time to time, a player would do really well and get on the high
score list and then type a swearword for his initials or something.

Buster! is of this type. You cannot blink or you lose! Can you play a
full three minutes? At least you don't have to keep feeding it
quarters....

This game was a class project for the Udemy course at https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse.
